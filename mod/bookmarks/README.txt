About Moodle Social Bookmarking
------------------------------- 
This project implements a del.ici.ous like Social Bookmarking Learning activity Module for the LMS Moodle.

Most of you will know del.icio.us and IÕm sure that some of you are using this service. So installing this module in your Moodle, you would be able to create mini-delicious activities inside your courses to do some kind of WebQuest?.

The main idea is that students search information about a topic using the World Wide Web and share whatever they find with their partners. Using this tool, links can be tagged and organized easily.

moodle-social-bookmarking is a project iniciated and developed  by Jordi Piguillem and Ludo(Marc Alier) at the GESSI research group at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya http://www.upc.edu.

See a [http://www.dfwikilabs.org/course/view.php?id=4 demo of Social Bookmarking for Moodle].
